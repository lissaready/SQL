#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--Q1 How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) AS Number_of_Orders_Jan
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


--Q2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) AS Number_of_iPhone_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


--Q3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


--Q4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
LIMIT 1;


--Q5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(quantity) * price) AS Total_Revenue, Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY Total_Revenue desc;


--Q6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, 
quantity, 
price, 
sum(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';


--Q7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
COUNT(cust.acctnum) AS Total_Customers,
ROUND(AVG(quantity * price),2) AS Average_Spend
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID'
AND feb.Quantity > 2;
